/*
Scheduler in Go
- part of the Go runtime that manages the execution of goroutines on available CPU cores.
- Go does not use OS threads directly for every goroutine; instead, it maps goroutines to a smaller number of OS threads, making execution efficient and scalable
 - lightweight goroutines instead of heavyweight threads
 - goroutines execution in parallel on multiple OS threads
 - uses a work-stealing algorithm for load balancing
 - optimized for high-performance concurrent applications.

Understanding the Go Schedulerâ€™s Execution Model
- Go uses G-P-M model (Goroutine (a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime), Processor (a logical processor that runs goroutines), Machine (an OS thread used to execute Go code)) to schedule goroutines
How it works:
1. Go runtime creates Goroutines (G)
2. Each goroutine is assigned to a Processor (P)
3. Processor (P) run on OS threads (M)
4. If a goroutine blocks (e.g. waiting for I/O), the scheduler moves another goroutines onto the thread
